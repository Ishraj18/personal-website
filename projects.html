          <h3>The future of Wireless technology</h3>
          <p><strong>V2X Technology for self-driving cars</strong> - <br>Both conventional and self-driving cars will need to communicate with each other, as well as with road infrastructure. This will be enabled by V2X wireless systems. In addition to
            exchanging information and status data, V2X can provide a multitude of other services, such as safety capabilities, navigation support and infotainment.
            “V2X will eventually become a legal requirement for all new vehicles. But even before this happens, we expect to see some vehicles incorporating the necessary protocols,” said Mr. Jones. “However, those V2X systems that use cellular will need
            a 5G network to achieve their full potential.”<br>

            <strong>5G Bandwidth</strong>-<br>5G cellular systems are starting to be deployed in 2019 and 2020. The complete rollout will take five to eight years. In some cases, the technology may supplement Wi-Fi, as it is more cost-effective for
            high-speed data networking in large sites, such as ports, airports and factories. “5G is still immature, and initially, most network operators will focus on selling high-speed broadband. However, the 5G standard is evolving and future
            iterations will improve 5G in areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and low-latency applications,” Mr. Jones added.<br>

            <strong>Wireless sensing</strong>- <br>The absorption and reflection of wireless signals can be used for sensing purposes. Wireless sensing technology can be used, for example, as an indoor radar system for robots and drones. Virtual assistants
            can also use radar tracking to improve their performance when multiple people are speaking in the same room.
            “Sensor data is the fuel of the IoT. Accordingly, new sensor technologies enable innovative types of applications and services,” Mr. Jones said. “Systems including wireless sensing will be integrated in a multitude of use cases, ranging from
            medical diagnostics to object recognition and smart home interaction.”<br>
            <strong>Millimeter Wave Wireless</strong>strong- <br> Millimeter wave wireless technology operates at frequencies in the range of 30 to 300 gigahertz, with wavelengths in the range of 1 to 10 millimeters. The technology can be used by wireless
            systems such as Wi-Fi and 5G for short-range, high-bandwidth communications (for example, 4K and 8K video streaming).<br>
            <strong>Li-Fi</strong>- <br> Li-Fi operates through LED bulbs, which connect to your computer or laptop via a dongle.<br>
            Throughout real-world testing, Li-Fi’s delivered a consistent speed of 1 gigabyte per second (Gbps). In labs, however, it’s reached 224 Gpbs, which is fast enough to download more than a dozen high-quality films in a single second. While this
            may be a possible real-world speed for future wireless networks, it’s unlikely for the near future.
            How will Wi-Fi network technology evolve with Li-Fi? First, by decreasing the amount of hardware needed by using a microchip controller. Second, by increasing the security of Wi-Fi communications by controlling light. And third, by
            streamlining wireless networks by integrating them with solar energy.
            Another technology that may influence the evolution of wireless technology includes Qualcomm’s small cells project, which focuses on the hyper-dense deployment of cells that act as a Wi-Fi hotspot but are only the size of a wireless access
            point.
